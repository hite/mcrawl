## Why 
Why do I create this crawler?

A: To test how the webpages behave in different regions simultaneously.

So deploy this service on many sites located in muitple regions.

## How to

1. Deploy this repo on any servers you own.
2. Run `npm install` at the root of repo.
2. Run `node index.mjs`

### Currently via URL
Type link like,
http://127.0.0.1:5789/crawl?url=https://news.163.com

Replace the value of url with the link you want to crawl && 
Replace the host part with your server's host.
